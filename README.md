# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

An end-to-end machine learning project that recommends movies based on user preferences using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on movie metadata
- 📚 Content-Based Filtering using TF-IDF on genres and descriptions
- 💾 Model training and serialization (Pickle)
- 🌐 Web app interface using Streamlit/Flask
- 🛠️ Ready for deployment

## 🧠 How It Works

This system uses this core approach:

**Content-Based Filtering**  
  Recommends movies similar to one the user liked based on genres, cast, director, and plot, among other factors.
